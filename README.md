## Blind Auction ##
__I created this program using my knowledge of Python dictionaries and loops.__  
#### Outlook: ####
* We're holding an audition for a very precious object.  
* There is no maximum number of bidders.
* After each registration of name and amount, the screen clears so it will remain secret from other players.  
* When there are no more bidders, the program will display the name of the winner and their winning bid.
